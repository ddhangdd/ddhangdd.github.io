I"h<p>Hey guys, I am Desmond. Currently a junior at <a href="https://www.wisc.edu/">UW Madison</a> majoring in <a href="https://www.cs.wisc.edu/">Computer Science</a> and <a href="https://stat.wisc.edu/">Statistic</a>.</p>

<p>Lanyon is an unassuming Jekyll theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. It’s based on Poole, the Jekyll butler.</p>

<p>Built on Poole
Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as an upstanding and effective foundation for Jekyll themes by @mdo. Poole, and every theme built on it (like Lanyon here) includes the following:</p>

<p>Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, 404, RSS feed, posts, and example page)
Mobile friendly design and development
Easily scalable text and component sizing with rem units in the CSS
Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)
Lanyon features
In addition to the features of Poole, Lanyon adds the following:</p>

<p>Toggleable sliding sidebar (built with only CSS) via ☰ link in top corner
Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support
Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and reverse (right sidebar), available via &lt;body&gt; classes
Eight optional color schemes, available via &lt;body&gt; classes
Head to the readme to learn more.</p>

<p>Browser support
Lanyon is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.</p>

<p>Download
Lanyon is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the GitHub repository for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
